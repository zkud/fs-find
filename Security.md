## Reporting a Bug

The author takes all security bugs in fs-find seriously.
Thank you for improving the security of fs-find. I appreciate your efforts and
responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge your
contributions.

Report security bugs by creating an issue on the [fs-find project repo](https://github.com/zkud/fs-find).

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining
the module.

## Disclosure Policy

When the I receive a security bug report, I will coordinate the fix and release process,
involving the following steps:

  * Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
  * Audit code to find any potential similar problems.
  * Prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance. These fixes will be
    released as fast as possible to npm.

## Comments on this Policy
